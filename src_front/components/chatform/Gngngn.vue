				<p>So, you're angry.</p>
				<p>That's something I can understand.</p>
				<p>May i share my point of view on this?</p>
				<br>
				<p>Twitchat is made by a single person <i>(<a href="http://twitch.tv/durss" target="_blank">hello üëã</a>)</i>) and required at the very least 8 months of <strong>FULL TIME</strong> work to date <i>(dec. 2022)</i>.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I'm allowing everyone to use it for free but it costs me money and a lot of time and efforts. I don't get ANY revenue from it besides very few donations <i>(on which I pay 30% taxes)</i>.</p>
				<p>I'm <strong>not</strong> sponsored by any company, I'm <strong>not</strong> gathering your personal info to sell them, and It's ad free <i>(yes)</i>.</p>
				<p><strong>We're not talking about advertising</strong> here. I'm not advertising for products or whatever that would generate constant revenues.</p>
				<p>I'm just sharing a link to Twitchat.</p>
				<br>
				<p><strong>You can donate to disable it.</strong></p>
				<p>I'm not even asking for a specific amount. You can donate 1‚Ç¨ if you think my work isn't worth more than that, and you'll be able to disable that message.</p>
				<br>
				<p>And if you don't want to pay anything, Twitchat is <a href="https://github.com/Durss/Twitchat" target="_blank">open-source</a>. You're free to create an instance for yourself.</p>
				<br>
				<p>For all these reasons, I don't think it's horrific to push a sporadic message on your chat and I see no good reason for you to be angry about that.</p>
				<br>
				<p>If you still think this automatic message is unacceptable, you're free to stop using Twitchat!</p>
				<p>But, please, <strong>don't take free services for granted</strong>. They require a lots of time, efforts and knowledge to create.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I hope this makes things look less "evil" and that you understand my point of view :)</p>
				<p>‚ù§ Have a nice stream ‚ù§</p>
				<br>
				<p>Best regards,</p>
				<p>Durss</p>

				<ToggleBlock class="block" title="Why posting with my account?" small :open="false">
					<p>Because it's the easiest and because, let's be honnest, if i was posting from another account you would ban it right away to block the message.</p>
				</ToggleBlock>
				<ToggleBlock class="block" title="I already tell my viewers about Twitchat regularly, I don't like this intrusive message!" small :open="false">
					<p>Well, thank you.</p>
					<p>But I have no way to know about that.</p>
					<p>Still, you can customize the message and everytime a link to "twitchat.fr" is sent on the chat <i>(by any viewer, wizebot, nightbot, etc...)</i> the timer is reset to 0.</p>
					<p>This means that when telling about Twitchat to your viewers, if you send the link, the 2h timer will be reset.</p>
