				"TW: cancer, death",
				"This space was intended to contain a piece of HTML code created with my father to share something with him and keep a souvenir of him.",
				"But fate had other plans, taking him away faster than expected.",
				"In the absence of a trace created by him here, I offer him this small tribute.",
				"Â ",
				"My father was a warrior because he fought cancer for 18 years, with over 130 chemotherapy sessions. But by the end of June 2023, the verdict was clear: the chemotherapy was no longer effective, and cancer had won.",
				"It was estimated that he had only a few months left to live, at most a year.",
				"But this news took a toll on his mental health; depression joined the battle with cancer, and just one month later, everything escalated.",
				"In early August, he lost all his cognitive abilities, his speech, his ability to eat and move, he no longer recognized some family members, was lost in the house he lived for +30 years, ...",
				"I was terrified by the thought of missing the opportunity to say goodbye and tell him I loved him before he ceased to be himself and disappeared.",
				"He was hospitalized for a week, and by some miracle, he regained all his mental faculties and motor skills.",
				"But this joy was short-lived.",
				"On September 4th, his body couldn't hold on any longer, and he was hospitalized once again.",
				"On September 7th, he sought the approval of the doctor who had been following him for all these years and the rest of the family to end his life before the cancers caused too much suffering and permanently affected his cognitive abilities. Aware that he was in the terminal phase, he no longer had any purpose that gave him the will to fight.",
				"As difficult as it was, this decision made him smile again. He was laughing again, cracking jokes and punchlines as he used to.",
				"He remained joyful until the very end.",
				"On September 10th at 12 o'clock, he was placed in deep sedation, waiting for his body to collapse... he fell asleep hearing us, overcome by a fit of laughter mixed with tears of joy and devastation.",
				"Perhaps this laughter also lightened the situation for the nurse who found it very difficult to accompany a conscious, sharp-minded man towards death, someone who was always kind to the medical staff.",
				"18 years.",
				"18 years during which our mother accompanied him, supported him, and did absolutely everything sho could for him.",
				"If my father was a warrior, my mother is an immense warrior to whom we owe so much for having had 18 more years with our father.",
				"Goodbye, my dear Pap's ðŸ’–"
