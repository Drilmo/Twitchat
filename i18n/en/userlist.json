		"Also, nothing's official, but it's almost certain that Twitch removes you from the viewers count if you keep the stream on a background tab for some time.",
		"This usually makes your chatters count higher than your viewers count after a raid.",
		"When promoted on homepage though, your viewer count will be MUCH higher than your chatters count."
